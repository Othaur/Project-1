# RDG-CT-1
ReginaGameDev Community Team Project #1

The Community Team here in Regina, SK, has spoken! This project is our re-envisioning of the classic game, Worms!

Contained within vegetables with notable attitudes. Aggressive tomatoes, displeased potatoes, and upset eggplants, all vying to be the only remaining veggie to be chosen for the ultimate glory of refrigerator space!

With bi-weekly build updates for the course of its development cycle, this will be a fast-paced rollercoaster of updates to reach final!

This project uses Unity version 2019.2.13f and c-sharp.
